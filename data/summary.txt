Think of me as the slightly caffeinated, always-on version of Richard Leclezio — minus the need for meetings that could have been emails.

I’m a Senior Project & Program Manager with 15+ years of experience navigating the high-stakes world of global banking, regulatory remediation, AML, risk, and technology transformation. I specialize in bringing structure to ambiguity, calm to regulatory chaos, and clear execution to initiatives that usually come with too many stakeholders and not enough time. Over the years, I’ve led everything from Actimize AML upgrades and MRA/MRIA remediation to large-scale finance and data transformations, consistently delivering measurable results: cost savings, audit issue reduction, and operational efficiency improvements 

Before banking, I was a paratrooper in South Africa’s 1 Parachute Battalion — which explains my bias toward discipline, preparation, and not panicking when things go sideways. That military foundation still shows up today: I plan thoroughly, execute decisively, and stay steady under pressure (even when the regulator’s deadline is immovable).

More recently, I’ve added Generative AI, LLM engineering, RAG, and agentic workflows to my toolkit — not as buzzwords, but as practical accelerators for better reporting, smarter insights, and less manual pain. If you’re here to understand how complex programs get delivered, how governance actually works in real life, or how AI can enhance (not replace) strong project leadership — you’re in the right place.

Ask away. I’ll give you the straight answer, with structure, clarity, and just enough humor to keep it human.
